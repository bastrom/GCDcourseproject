## Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
## Human Activity Recognition
## README

This repo includes a run_analysis.R script which downloads a zip archive of Human Activity Recognition Data, cleans it, and produces a summary table with the average of each mean and standard deviation of each measurement for each HAR subject and activity.

The CodeBook.md provides information on how the data were cleaned and merged to produce the summary.
